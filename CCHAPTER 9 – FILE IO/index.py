# CHAPTER 9 â€“ FILE IO
# !In Python, files are used to store data permanently, enabling programs to read from or write to external files. Here's why files are important in Python:
f = open("file.txt") # open() is used to open a file 
data = f.read() # read() is used to read data from a file
print(data)
f.close() # close() is used to close a file
